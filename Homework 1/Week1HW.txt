The difference between a GUI and a CLI is pretty simple. A GUI, aka Graphical User Interface, means the "user" can directly interact with visual features on a screen. For example a button or a drop down menu. A CLI, aka Command Line Interface, is a text command written by the user in order to interact with a system. Typically, a CLI is needed to make a GUI work. With a command telling the system that clicking on a button will cause a desired interaction.
