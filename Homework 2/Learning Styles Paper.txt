	Based on the research mentioned in the article it almost to me sounds like learning styles are like a placebo affect. You feel like learning one way or another helps you understand things better and retain more information. I personally thinks there's some merit to learning styles, because it's what your brain finds easiest to compute. It's not that people who don't consider themselves visual learners can't learn anything from looking at visuals, it's more-so that they might have a harder time retaining the information. They might learn better being shown exactly how to do something, or by listening to information being read at loud. People also don't learn exclusively using only 1 of the styles, it could just depend on the information being shared. I consider myself a visual learner but retain certain information better if I hear something being read to me as opposed to reading it myself. I think learning styles just make it easier for people to remember information the first time they learn it.
