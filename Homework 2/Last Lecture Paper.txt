	I think the Last Lecture video was really informative, but one thing that stuck with me the whole video was the fact that he brought up his tumors just at the beginning of the lecture and then it's never mentioned again. He goes on to talk about his childhood bucket list and how he checked off each item on said list, finding creative ways to make his dreams happen. Randy gave us a glimpse into different times in his life where he achieved some pretty amazing things, all the while knowing as the viewer that he only has a few months left. He doesn't dwell on the "should have done" or "wish he could," instead looking back on all the things he did do. Finding positive in the negative, knowing that he's lived his life exactly how he wanted to, even if it's getting cut short. I think I really identified with his statement about karma, how if you're good to people and strive to do your best good things will come your way. His stories also remind me of something my dad tells me a lot: it's not about what you know, it's about who you know. There were so many people in Randy's life who helped him reach those goals, through his connections he was able to succeed in all the things he wanted to do. It wasn't just the people he knew though, he saw loopholes and turned them into opportunities. He took every chance he was given to work towards achieving his goals. Even when things didn't quite work out as he hoped he didn't give up and instead kept trying and trying till he got what he wanted.
